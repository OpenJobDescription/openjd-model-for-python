# *******************
# READ THIS if you want to understand what's going on in this file.
# *******************
#
# What are we doing here?
# ------
# The function 'prevalidate_model_template_variable_references()' exported from this
# module is used internally to this package/library to check/validate that template
# variable references within a template (Job or Environment) are to variables that
# have been defined within the template, and that they exist at the scope of the reference.
# Variable references to variables that don't exist in the scope are flagged as validation
# errors and returned by the function.
#
# For example,
# {
#   "specificationVersion": "jobtemplate-2023-09",
#   "name": " {{ Param.JobName }}",
#   "parameterDefinitions": [
#      { "name": "Name", "type": "STRING "}
#   ],
#   ... and so on
# }
# would have an error at the _root_.name field because the template variable "Param.JobName" does
# not exist (the declared parameter is called "Param.Name" or "RawParam.Name").
#
# The current OpenJD models make use of a limited number of field types, and so this implementation
# only caters to those fields that we use. Specifically, we currently have fields that are the following
# shapes:
# class FieldTypesUsed(OpenJDModel):
#    # Singleton field types
#    # -----
#    literal: Literal[EnumClass.member]
#    scalar: int, str, FormatString, Decimal, etc.
#    discriminated_union: Annotated[Union[OpenJDModel, OpenJDModel, ...], Field(..., discriminator=<fieldname>)
#    union: Union[<list-of-scalars>, <scalar>] or Union[<scalar-type>, <scalar-type>, ...]
#    # -----
#    # List field types:
#    # -----
#    list_field: list[<singleton>]
#    # -----
#    # Dictionary field types:
#    # -----
#    dict_field: dict[str, <singleton>]
#
# This is a piece of a larger suite of validators that are run on the given input, and need only
# be narrowly concerned with validating that references to variables are correct. Other errors, such
# as parsing or model-mismatch errors are detected by other validators in the suite.
#
# How are we doing it?
# ----
# We're given both:
#  1) The root class of the template model (e.g. JobTemplate or EnvironmentTemplate); and
#  2) *Prevalidation* candidate data for that model as a dict[str, Any].
#
# Only field values of a type derived from OpenJDModel can *define* a template variable, and only
# field values that are of type FormatString can *reference* a template variable.
# So, we do a depth-first preorder traversal of the template model in sync with the given value dictionary. Each
# node of this traversal is of a model type derived from OpenJDModel.
#
# At each node of the traversal we:
#  1) Recursively collect the set of template variable names that are available to the current node:
#      - The node's parent may have template variable definitions that are made available to this node.
#      - Child nodes of this one may export their template variable definitions to this node.
#      - The node itself my define template variables for reference within it and its children.
#  2) Then inspect each field of the model:
#      a) FormatStrings to ensure that they only reference defined variables; and
#      b) Recursively traverse into members that are of type derived from OpenJDModel; these are the members
#         that may contain template variable references within their members.
#
# It is possible for a given template to contain multiple variable reference errors, and we want to report *all* of them
# so that users do not have to play find-the-error whack-a-mole (validate, fix the one error, re-validate, fix the new error, repeat...).
#
# Through all of this we keep in mind that our input *data* may not match our model at all (e.g. we're expecting an OpenJDModel for
# a field but are given a value that's a string, int, or other non-dict type).
#
# What else do I need to know?
# ---
# 1. Every template variable is defined at one of three scopes. That scope defines where that variable is available for reference.
#    See the docstring for the ResolutionScope class for information on these scopes.
#     - If the OpenJDModel._template_variable_scope member has a value, then it indicates a change of scope in the traversal; the node
#       and all children (until another scope change) resolve variable references using this given scope.
# 2. An OpenJDModel can define template variables.
#    - Information on which variables a model defines, if any, are encoded in that model's `_template_variable_definitions` field.
#      See the docstring of the DefinesTemplateVariables class for information on how variables are defined.
# 3. An OpenJDModel can export template variable definitions to their parent in the template model, and have to declare which, if any,
#    of their fields variable definitions are passed in to.
#    - Information on this is encoded in the model's `_template_variable_sources` field. See the comment for this field in the
#      OpenJDModel base class for information on this property
# 4. Since this validation is a pre-validator, we basically have to re-implement a fragment of Pydantic's model parser for this
#    depth first traversal. Thus, you'll need to know the following about Pydantic v1.x's data model and parser to understand this
#    implementation:
#    a) All models are derived from pydantic.BaseModel
#    b) pydantic.BaseModel.__fields__: dict[str, pydantic.ModelField] is injected into all BaseModels by pydantic's BaseModel metaclass.
#       This member is what gives pydantic information about each of the fields defined in the model class. The key of the dict is the
#       name of the field in the model.
#    c) pydantic.ModelField describes the type information about a model's field:
#        i) pydantic.ModelField.shape is an integer that defines the shape of the field
#                SHAPE_SINGLETON means that it's a singleton type.
#                SHAPE_LIST means that it's a list type.
#                SHAPE_DICT means that it's a dict type.
#                etc.
#       ii) pydantic.ModelField.type_ gives you the type of the field; this is only useful for scalar singleton fields.
#       iii) pydantic.ModelField.sub_fields: Optional[list[pydantic.ModelField]] exists for list, dictionary, and union-typed singleton
#            fields:
#            1. For SHAPE_LIST: sub_fields has length 1, and its element is the ModelField for the elements of the list.
#            2. For SHAPE_DICT: sub_fields has length 1, and its element is the ModelField for the value-type of the dict.
#            3. For SHAPE_SINGLETON:
#                 a) For scalar-typed fields: sub_fields is None
#                 b) For union-typed fields: sub_fields is a list of all of the types in the union
#       iv) For discriminated unions:
#            1. pydantic.ModelField.discriminator_key: Optional[str] exists and it gives the name of the submodel field used to
#               determine which type of the union a given data value is.
#            2. pydantic.sub_fields_mapping: Optional[dict[str,pydantic.ModelField]] exists and can be used to find the unioned type
#               for a given discriminator value.
